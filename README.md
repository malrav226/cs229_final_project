# cs229_final_project
Final Project for CS 229

Code for the final project can be found in cs229_final_code.py. 
We also have uploaded jupyter notebook with all of the code written for the final project, which is CS229_FINAL_CODE.ipynb. Note that large outputs (primarily from NN training) are printed after some of these cells. 

We also include the code from our milestone report, but this is accounted for in CS229_FINAL_CODE.ipynb as well.
